term.terms.title2	= Sharing Your Content and Information
term.terms.text2	= You own all of the content and information you post on Acme:
term.terms.text2.1	= When you delete some content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time.
term.terms.text2.2	= When you publish content or information (except your personal information), it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Acme, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you(i.e., your name).

term.terms.title3	= Registration and Account Security
term.terms.text3	= Acme users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account:
term.terms.text3.1	= You will not provide any false personal information on Acme, or create an account for anyone other than yourself without permission.

term.terms.title6	= Adult Nudity & Sexual Activity
term.terms.text6.1	= People sometimes share content containing nudity for reasons like awareness campaigns or artistic projects. We restrict the display of nudity and sexual activity because some audiences within our global community may be sensitive to this type of content - particularly because of their cultural background or age. In order to treat people fairly and respond to reports quickly, it is essential that we have policies in place that our global teams can apply uniformly and easily when reviewing content. As a result, our policies can sometimes be more blunt than we would like and restrict content shared for legitimate purposes. We are always working to get better at evaluating this content and enforcing our standards.
term.terms.text6.2	= We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing in on fully exposed buttocks. We also restrict some images of female breasts if they include the nipple, but our intent is to allow images that are shared for medical or health purposes. We also allow photos of women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing breasts with post-mastectomy scarring. We also allow photographs of paintings, sculptures, and other art that depicts nude figures. Restrictions on the display of sexual activity also apply to digitally created content unless the content is posted for educational, humorous, or satirical purposes. Explicit images of sexual intercourse are prohibited. Descriptions of sexual acts that go into vivid detail may also be removed.

term.terms.title7	= Violence and Graphic Content
term.terms.text7.1	= Acme has long been a place where people share their experiences and raise awareness about important issues. Sometimes, those experiences and issues involve violence and graphic images that are of public interest or concern, such as human rights abuses or acts of terrorism. In many instances, when people share this type of content, they are condemning it or raising awareness about it. We remove graphic images when they are shared for sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence. We also remove extremely graphic videos, such as those depicting a beheading.
term.terms.text7.2	= When people share anything on Acme, we expect that they will share it responsibly, including carefully choosing who will see that content. We also ask that people warn their audience about what they are about to see if it includes graphic violence. With that said, there is also certain extreme graphic content that we recognize may be disturbing and we add a warning screen to it so that people are aware before they see it.
